This course allows students to access additional support for content delivered in their other classes each semester. The primary focus will be on Git, a version control system essential for collaborative software development. Each student will engage in a self-assessment process to identify areas where they need help, after which a personalized support plan will be established with the teaching team. Mentors, tutors, and workshops will be available to assist students in real-time.
